# Week 2 | Forward & Inverse Kinematics

## ðŸ“† Scope
Week 2 covers **Day 8 â€“ Day 14** of the 30-day plan.  
The focus is on building modular tools for **Forward Kinematics (FK)** and stepping into **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**.

---

## Overview of the Week
- **Day 8**: Modular Forward Kinematics tool (class-based design)
- **Day 9**: Matrix chain implementation of FK
- **Day 10**: Comparison: PyBullet FK vs hand-written FK
- **Day 11**: Rotation matrices and Euler angle conversions
- **Day 12**: Deeper practice with homogeneous transformations
- **Day 13**: Introduction to numerical IK
- **Day 14**: Testing IK with constraints

## Week 2 Learning Reflection (Day8â€“Day14)
This week I built a deeper understanding of forward and inverse kinematics. Through implementing a modular FK solver, I learned how to compute link poses relative to the base frame and why homogeneous transformations make chained motions easier to reason about. Moving to IK, I implemented a Jacobian-based Damped Least Squares solver, which taught me how end-effector errors can be mapped back into joint updates. I realized that damping is essential to handle singularities and that convergence depends on initial guesses, joint limits, and task constraints. By experimenting, I developed practical intuition: FK is deterministic, while IK may fail or require multiple strategies. Although I still need to study the math of matrix derivatives more rigorously, I can now clearly explain the principles of FK and IK, and I know how engineering systems often rely on robust solvers like TRAC-IK when tasks involve complex constraints such as grasp orientations.

## Day8

### Achievement

Built a Forward Kinematics tool class that converts joint angles into end-effector position and orientation.
Designed in a modular way so it can be reused in later days (matrix FK, IK, motion planning).
Successfully tested with the Franka Panda robot in PyBullet.

### How to Run
Navigate to your package directory:  
   ```
   bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_panda_sim/my_panda_sim
   python3 test_fk.py
   ```
---
## Day9
### Achievement
Built a MatrixChainDebugger class to print each step and the cumulative result
Verified matrix multiplication order with a test script

### How to Run
```
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_panda_sim/my_panda_sim
   python3 test_matrix_chain.py

```

## Day10
### Achievement
Implemented ForwardKinematics (FKSolver) as a reusable class that can compute the end-effector pose from given joint angles.

Built a ROS2 node (fk_publisher) that:

Uses FKSolver internally.

Publishes the computed end-effector pose to the topic /fk_pose.

Currently uses a fixed test joint configuration (q_test) for demonstration.

Created a launch file (display.launch.py) to start:

robot_state_publisher with Panda URDF.

A static transform (world â†’ panda_link0).

The fk_publisher node.

Integrated everything into setup.py with proper console entry points.

Outcome: The FK tool is no longer just a math script â€” it is now a proper ROS2 node that can publish results, preparing the system for multi-node integration in later weeks.

## Day11
### Achievement

Upgraded ForwardKinematics into a modular FKSolver:
Added bullet_state_guard to protect simulation state.
Supports arbitrary target link index, not limited to end-effector.
Provides two output modes:

(pos, quat) â†’ for ROS2 PoseStamped
T_base_link (4Ã—4) â†’ for Jacobian, IK, and trajectory planning

Implemented FKPublisher ROS2 node:
Subscribes to /joint_states for joint angles.
Uses FKSolver to compute forward kinematics.
Publishes /fk_pose (PoseStamped) with the end-effector pose in the base frame.
Achieved a complete pipeline: JointState â†’ FK â†’ PoseStamped â†’ ROS2 topic.

## Day 12-14
### Achievement
Implemented a Jacobian-based Damped Least Squares (DLS) IK solver, capable of solving end-effector positions from arbitrary joint configurations.
Gained practical understanding of how Jacobian relates joint velocities to end-effector motions, and how damping stabilizes solutions near singularities.
Explored joint limits, convergence issues, and developed intuition about when IK succeeds, fails, or requires multiple initial guesses.
